        including old Vesemir, CoÃ«n, Eskel, and Lambert.

        Ciri is linked to Geralt because he called The Law of Surprise jokingly

        Geralt of Rivia is a Witcher, one of the few capable of hunting the
        monsters that prey on humanity. A mutant who is tasked with killing

        But a contract has gone wrong, and Geralt finds himself without his
        signature weapons. Now he needs them back, because sorcerers are
